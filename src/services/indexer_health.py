"""Indexer failure accounting, and the `/health` view of it (#308, D4).

For 8.5 days an indexer failed every tick while `/health` answered `ok` and the
only signal was one CRITICAL log line nobody read — and in multi-user mode the
failures were not even counted, because the counter was a local of the
single-user branch of `run_indexer_loop`. This module is the one place those
counts now live, so that every entrypoint (the startup pass, the periodic tick
in both modes, the panel's Reindex now) updates the same state and `/health`
can read it.

**Per scope** — `None` for single-user mode, else the user id:

- `index_consecutive_failures`: an index pass that raised (after the
  quarantine recovery); reset by one that returned;
- `embed_consecutive_failures`: an embed pass that reported failures (or
  raised); reset by one with none;
- `rederive_incomplete`: a committed re-derive that withheld its provenance
  stamp; reset by one that recorded it, or by a pass that was not a re-derive;
- `last_success_at` / `last_failure_at` of the index stage.

**Process-wide**: consecutive tick-level failures not attributable to a scope
(user enumeration, root-overlap detection, a tick that raised outside any
scope's stages); whether the indexer task is still running; whether indexing
is disabled (`MCP_SANDBOX_MODE`); and a pluggable count of quarantined notes.

**In-process only and never persisted**: a restart starts clean, which is the
same horizon as the task it describes. `/health` reads `snapshot()`, which
carries counts only — no path, error text, SQLSTATE or user id, because
`/health` is unauthenticated and publicly routed.

The CRITICAL "manual intervention required" line is logged once when a counter
first reaches `INDEXER_DEGRADED_AFTER_FAILURES`, and re-armed when the counter
resets — once per episode, not once per tick.
